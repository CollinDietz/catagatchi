Cathacks 2016 submission


This is the Cathacks Hackathon submission from my team in 2016. This game was inspired by the Tamagotchi toys that each of us had played
with as children. The game was developed to play in a somewhat similar manner to the original game while featuring many faces and concepts
that could be found on the University of Kentucky's campus. The game plays as a live challenge to make the creature survive from egg stage
until the end with resource management being the primary challenge.

The game was developed in under 24 hours using C# and Microsoft Forms, a technology we had no prior experience with before this project.
Thank you for viewing our project, and enjoy the game!

The game was made in using Winforms in visual studio, a technology that we were not aware was no longer in use until after the competition. The game has a pseudo game loop run by several timers on triggering events at repeated intervals, such as lowering health or recharging energy. Simple animations are made the same way, with the image item on the WinForm switching back and forth on 1 second intervals between the two images. The code overall is very gross and inefficient, as it was written in one quick run over an entire night, but we were able to make a functional game in a language we had not directly used before (C#) and a technology that was completely new to us (WinForms).
